# Machine-learning-prediction
Machine Learning project to predict loan default using U.S. SBA data (1962–2014). Includes EDA, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, PCA, and K-Means Clustering. Final model achieves AUC of 0.9996.

# Predicting Loan Default Using Machine Learning

This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict loan default risk using real-world data from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The dataset spans over 899,000 loans between 1962–2014.

## Techniques Used
- Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors
- Unsupervised Learning: PCA, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- Performance Metrics: ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

## Key Results
- Final model: Random Forest (AUC = 0.9996, Recall = 0.9977)
- Feature importance highlights: Loan term, approval year, and charge-off amount
- Clustering revealed 4 borrower segments with risk-based grouping (6.5% to 25.1% default rate)
